# jvm-bench

the md5 algorithm written in java, kotlin and scala
in order to know if there's a difference in perfomance
due to produced bytecode

turns out there isn't much

---

the java version comes from [https://rosettacode.org/wiki/MD5/Implementation#Java](here)

the kotlin version was made with [https://try.kotlinlang.org/#/Kotlin%20Koans/Introduction/Java%20to%20Kotlin%20conversion/Task.kt](this)

and the scala version was translated from the java one by hand
